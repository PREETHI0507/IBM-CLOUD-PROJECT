# ‚ö° Power System Fault Detection Using Machine Learning

This project presents a machine learning-based solution to automatically detect and classify faults in power distribution systems. By analyzing electrical parameters such as voltage, current, and phasor measurements, the model predicts fault types, helping maintain the stability and efficiency of the power grid.

## üìå Problem Statement

Power distribution systems are prone to various types of faults such as line-to-ground, line-to-line, and three-phase faults. These faults can disrupt power supply and reduce system reliability. The challenge lies in accurately detecting and classifying these faults using electrical data, ensuring quick recovery and grid stability.

## üöÄ Proposed Solution

- Use supervised machine learning (Random Forest or SVM) to classify fault types.
- Train the model using labeled electrical parameter data.
- Deploy the model to IBM Watson Studio with an accessible API endpoint.
- Enable real-time predictions to support automated fault detection.
